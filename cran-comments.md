Fixed the license template and formatting issues in the description as 
requested. 
The paper outlining the method is currently under review. 
As such, we cannot include a reference with a DOI in the description
in this initial submission. We anticipate adding this reference to 
future iterations of the package.   

(7-3-2019)
As previously mentioned, the requested references can not be provided at this 
time. I will add references to the description once our paper has completed
the review process.

I have confirmed that all examples and tests run using only 1 core.
